# Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis

This is a **personal project** created to deepen my understanding of **data analysis**, with a specific focus on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The goal is to practice **cleaning, visualizing, and interpreting real-world data** while extracting meaningful insights from the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset.

Through this project, I explore patterns in content types, genres, countries, release years, and ratings, applying Python libraries such as **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly**. The project demonstrates both **technical skills and the ability to tell a story with data**, making the analysis clear and reproducible.
