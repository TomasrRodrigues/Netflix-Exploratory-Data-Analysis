    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was developed as a **personal learning exercise** to strengthen my skills in **data analysis**, with a particular focus on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The goal is twofold:  \n",
    "1. To practice the process of **cleaning, exploring, and visualizing real-world data**.  \n",
    "2. To extract **meaningful insights** about the structure and trends of Netflix content.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this analysis comes from [Kaggle’s *Netflix Movies and TV Shows* dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows), which contains information such as titles, release years, countries, genres, ratings, and durations. This rich dataset provides an excellent opportunity to explore patterns in Netflix’s catalog and to demonstrate the application of various Python tools for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Before starting\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the dataset, it is essential to import the core Python libraries that will support the analysis. These libraries provide the necessary tools for data manipulation, numerical computations, and visualization, forming the foundation of most modern data analysis workflows."
